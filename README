This is a simple dejunking script for IDAPython.  Currently supports
simple patterns with wildcards.  The pattern is as follows:

{
    'pattern':[0xEB,0x02,'??','??'],
    'fillwith':[0x90, 0x90, 0x90, 0x90],
}

The pattern above will match EB 02 and the 2 bytes following as
"wildcards".  The sizes of pattern and fillwith should be the same to
avoid issues when patching.  End patterns work similarly but with no
"fillwith" field.  Once patterns are set, use one of the following
functions in the IDAPython console:

dejunk_until_end()
Searches for end patterns specified in end_patterns and dejunks
code from cursor until found pattern.

dejunk_selection()
Hilight the area you wish to dejunk and execute this function to dejunk
and re-analyze any code selected.
